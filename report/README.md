## Introduction
The Music & Mental Health Survey Dataset comes from Kaggle and was compiled by Catherine Rasgaitis based on a survey about music-listening habits and their connection to mental health that respondents filled out via Google Forms. The form was posted on different social media platforms such as Reddit and Discord. The dataset has a CC0: Public Domain license and consists of 737 rows and 33 columns.

Our team is FabFour, consisting of Allison Fellhauer, Olena Sokolovska, Judy Lee, and Jessica Luo. 

Judy is a 5th-year computer science major and data science minor with a background in product design (UX/UI). She is particularly drawn to the music and mental health survey dataset because it combines two of her passions: music and mental health. As someone who is often found listening to music, Judy has a personal connection to how it can influence emotions and well-being. The dataset resonates with her as it provides an opportunity to explore how music impacts mental health and analyze the data to uncover meaningful insights.

Our intended audience includes individuals who are passionate about music or mental health, such as music enthusiasts, mental health professionals, and researchers interested in the intersection of the two fields. Since this dataset allows for the visual exploration of how different music genres correlate with mental health conditions like anxiety and depression, we aim to provide valuable insights through data visualizations. These insights will help people better understand how music influences emotional well-being and overall mental health.
