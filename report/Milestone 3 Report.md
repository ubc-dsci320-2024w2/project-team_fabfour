## Research Questions
[ Here will we will include our research questions again ]

**Allison's** research question is: **What is the impact of the respondent's age on their survey responses?**
- Does Age Influence the Relationship Between Music Genre Preferences and Mental Health Scores? How do music preferences correlate with mental health scores for different age groups? 
- How Does Age Influence the Relationship Between Music Engagement and Mental Health Outcomes? Examine how different forms of music engagement (e.g., instrumentalist, composer) correlate with mental health outcomes across various age groups. Do those who engage with music in more dimensions (e.g. composer or musician) form distinct groups?

**Judy's** research question is: **How does the favorite genre and the diversity of music genres an individual listens to influence the perceived music effects on their well-being and their self-reported mental health conditions?**

Some sub-research questions worth exploring would be:
- Are there specific favorite genres that are more commonly associated with positive or negative perceived effects of music on well-being?
- Are individuals who listen to a variety of music genres more likely to report that music improves their well-being compared to those with low diversity, regardless of their favorite genre?
- Do individuals with different mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, insomnia, OCD) tend to have distinct music preferences?

**Helena's** research question is: **What is the relationship between specific mental illnesses and listening habits?**
- Are any mental illnesses associated with specific listening habits (specific platforms, favourite genre, listening while working, frequency of specific genres, exploratory tastes, foreign languages, etc.)?

**Jessica's** research question is: **How does response bias play a role in self-reporting mental health severity?**

Further questions worth exploring might be:
- What are the patterns and anomalies in self-reported mental health severities?
- How do demographics (eg. mental illness), music listening habits contribute to biased self-reporting?
- Are there any reasons for extreme/invalid response values that can be identified based on other responses?
- How do illogical, invalid responses influence data reliability?
The visualization may be a dashboard with interactions, or SPLOM with outlier points that are linked bi-directionally to other visualizations.
