## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The [Music & Mental Health Survey Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results) comes from Kaggle.
It was compiled by Catherine Rasgaitis based on a survey about music-listening habits and their connection to mental health that respondents filled out via Google Forms.
The form was posted on different social media platforms such as Reddit and Discord.
The dataset has a CC0: Public Domain license and consists of 737 rows and 33 columns.

Allison is currently a Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) student interested in machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. Coming from a background in biology with a minor in psychology, she has a strong foundation in cognition and positive psychology‚Äîboth of which explored the positive impact of music on mental health. Her interest in the Music and Mental Health dataset stems from her passion for understanding how music influences emotional well-being and how it can uplift individuals from languishing to flourishing.

Judy is a 5th-year computer science major and data science minor with a background in product design (UX/UI).
She is particularly drawn to the music and mental health survey dataset because it combines two of her passions: music and mental health.
As someone who is often found listening to music, Judy has a personal connection to how it can influence emotions and well-being.
The dataset resonates with her as it provides an opportunity to explore how music impacts mental health and analyze the data to uncover meaningful insights.

Helena is also a Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) student and data science minor. During her time as a medical researcher (genetics, molecular/cell biology, cancer/microbiome/organoid research), she also began following mental health research due to personal interest. She has recently become aware of a study finding that individuals with depression gravitate towards sad music. This poses the question: do depressed individuals perpetuate their depression via their listening habits? She is interested to see if other mental illnesses are also associated with specific music tastes.

As a Behavioural Neuroscience student, Jessica is interested in any topic in the area of mental health.
She grew up with music as a core component of life and appreciates the diversity of benefits that many people can obtain from listening, making and appreciating music.
When Jessica was a Crisis Line Volunteer supporting callers with mental health challenges,
she heard from many help-seekers that music was something people turned to when they felt anxious, stressed, depressed, restless or lonely.
