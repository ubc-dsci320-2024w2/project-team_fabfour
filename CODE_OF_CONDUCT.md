# Code of Conduct

[This text is from GitHub's Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project).

A code of conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community.
It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions.
It also outlines procedures for addressing problems between members of your project's community.
For more information on why a code of conduct defines standards and expectations for how to engage in a community, see the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/).

## Diversity and Inclusivity
We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.
As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our group members that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others.
We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality,
ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof),
membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone who participates in our DSCI 320 group project is required to conform to this Code of Conduct.
It applies to all spaces including, but not limited to, class meetings, text or Discord communication, and online platforms such as EdStem and GitHub.
Each member of the team is expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

## Expected Behavior
All group members are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.
All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person.
In order to foster a positive and professional environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all DSCI 310 events and platforms:
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
Note: See the four social rules for further recommendations.

## Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any DSCI 100 event/platform include:
- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop publication of private communication without consent

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Group members who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.
This applies to any DSCI 320 events and platforms, either online or in-person.
If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct,
a group member may warn the offender and or engage the DSCI 320 teaching team to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.

## Incident Reporting Guidelines
If someone violates the Code of Conduct at any time, or in an online space outside of organised project work time,
a group member will report the violation(s) to the DSCI 320 teaching team, as listed in the DSCI 320 syllabus.
An email message to the email addresses listed in the course syllabus will be seen by each respective instructor.
